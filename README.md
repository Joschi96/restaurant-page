# The Floating Feast - A Restaurant Website

## Project Overview

This project is a part of an assignment for **The Odin Project**, specifically from the module focused on **Webpack** and **npm**. The goal of this project is to practice using Webpack to bundle JavaScript files, manage dependencies, and create a modularized project structure. The project implements a fictional restaurant website called **"The Floating Feast"**, where I also practiced my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Webpack Configuration:** The project uses Webpack to bundle and serve JavaScript files.
- **Modular JavaScript:** The website is built using JavaScript modules to separate concerns and keep the code organized.
- **NPM Integration:** NPM is used to manage dependencies, including Webpack and any required loaders or plugins.
- **Responsive Design:** The project features responsive web design techniques, ensuring the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Menu:** The restaurant's menu is dynamically generated using JavaScript and rendered on the page.

## Structure of the Project

- **Webpack Setup:** The project is set up with Webpack as the module bundler, and the `src` folder contains all the main files:
  - `index.js`: The main entry point of the application.
  - `menu.js`: Module responsible for rendering the restaurant's menu.
  - `about.js`: Module responsible for rendering the "About Us" section of the restaurant.
  - `style.css`: The main stylesheet, linked using Webpack.
  
- **CSS Styling:** The project features custom CSS to style the webpage. Flexbox and media queries are used to ensure the design works well on various screen sizes.
