# The Floating Feast - A Restaurant Website

## Project Overview

This project is an assignment from **The Odin Project**, focusing on using **Webpack** and **npm** to create and organize a modular website. The restaurant website, **"The Floating Feast"**, is built to practice bundling JavaScript files, managing assets, and structuring the project using modern web development tools.

## Features

- **Webpack** for JavaScript and asset bundling.
- **NPM** for dependency management.
- **Modular JavaScript**: Different sections of the site (Home, Menu, About) are managed in separate JavaScript files.
- **Responsive CSS**: The site includes custom styling to create a clean, flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Content**: The menu and about sections are dynamically injected into the page via JavaScript modules.

## File Structure

Below is a quick overview of the `src` folder contents and what each file does:

### Files in `src` Folder:

- **about.js**: This JavaScript module renders the "About Us" section of the website.
- **home.js**: This file generates the content for the Home page, including the restaurant's header and introduction.
- **index.js**: The main entry point of the project, which loads the initial page setup and routes between different tabs (Home, Menu, About).
- **logo.jpg**: The image file used as the logo for the restaurant.
- **menu.js**: This module dynamically creates and renders the menu page with the restaurant's dishes and categories.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS for the entire project, managing the layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness.
- **template.html**: The basic HTML template that is injected with dynamic content through JavaScript modules.
